Hi, I'm Dinara.

An aspiring business & data analyst and middle software engineer, avid traveler, passionate about continuous learning, problem-solving, and empowering others through data-driven solutions.

I am pursuing a Master's degree in Applied Business Analytics at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/) and received a B.S. in Information and Communication Technology from [Kazakh-British Technical University](https://kbtu.edu.kz/en/). 

I’m skilled in Python, R, SQL, Tableau and Power BI, and I am deeply committed to using data and technology to solve business challenges.

<!-- During the final year of my bachelor's studies, I began working full-time as a Full-Stack Software Engineer in the banking industry at VTB Bank Kazakhstan. In this role, I applied my academic knowledge in real-world scenarios and gained significant experience. In this role, I developed web applications from the ground up, enhanced existing ones, and managed databases. My work involved third-party API integrations, performance tuning, and seamless deployment into production environments. I led frontend and backend development using technologies such as Java, Node.js, React, and Oracle APEX, and worked extensively with PostgreSQL and Oracle databases. Additionally, I utilized tools like DBMS Profiler and Query Analyzer to optimize query performance and ensure system reliability.

This experience led me to discover a fascination with data management and analytics — the way data surrounds us and can yield powerful insights into trends, behaviors, and decision-making. This interest inspired me to dive deeper into data analytics through online courses, and ultimately, to pursue a graduate degree in Applied Business Analytics at Boston University. So now, I'm a graduate student:) -->
